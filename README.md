## Steps applied: 
-	EDA techniques for analysis
-	Target Variable Analysis
-	Univariate analysis of Categorical Features
-	Bivariate analysis of Categorical Features
-	Analysis of Numerical Features
-	Detect missing values and handle them
-	Transformation of Numerical Features (scaling & encoding)
-	Train/test split: with train (70%), test (30%) with random_state = 0
-	Train the model
-	Evaluate the model

## Target: Achieve accuracy on test set >=0.90
